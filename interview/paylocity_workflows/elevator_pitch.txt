ELEVATOR PITCH - Paylocity Senior Software Testing Engineer
============================================================
Interview Date: October 30, 2025, 2:00 PM CST
Role Focus: Test Automation, Jest, Cypress, CI/CD Integration

"Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I'm Bernard Orozco, a Full Stack Engineer with over 10 years of experience, and I've specialized in building comprehensive test automation frameworks that deliver measurable quality improvements.

I'm particularly excited about this role at Paylocity because it perfectly aligns with my passion for quality engineering. Let me share three accomplishments that demonstrate my fit:

First, at JLL, I led the testing strategy for JLLGPT, an enterprise AI chatbot that initially had zero test coverage. I designed and implemented a comprehensive test automation suite using Jest and Cypress, creating over 200 test cases covering functional, API, and integration scenarios. The result? We achieved 90% test coverage and maintained zero production bugs over six months of operation.

Second, I didn't just write tests – I integrated quality into the entire development lifecycle. I successfully integrated our automated test suites into CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, ensuring that every pull request is validated before merge. This caught 12 critical bugs before they reached production.

Third, I've worked extensively with cross-browser compatibility testing, API testing including REST endpoints, JWT authentication flows, and comprehensive error handling scenarios – all critical for a SaaS platform serving 35,000+ clients like Paylocity does.

What really excites me about Paylocity is your modern tech stack with Jest, Cypress, and Playwright. I'm proficient in Jest and Cypress, and I'm confident I can quickly ramp up on Playwright and Selenium given their similar architectures. I'm based right here in Guadalajara, I work well within EST-aligned hours, and I see this as an opportunity to contribute my experience while also growing my skills in performance and security testing domains.

Your company's reputation as a G2 Top 100 Software Company tells me you take quality seriously, and that's exactly the kind of environment where I thrive.

What aspects of your current testing infrastructure would you like to discuss further?"

"Hi, I'm Bernard Orozco, a Full Stack Engineer with 10+ years in test automation. I specialize in building comprehensive testing frameworks – at JLL, I took an enterprise AI chatbot from 0% to 90% test coverage using Jest and Cypress with zero production bugs for six months.

I'm excited about Paylocity because you're using my exact tech stack – Jest and Cypress – and I love your focus on automation excellence. I'm based in Guadalajara, work EST-aligned hours, and I'm ready to help maintain quality for your 35,000+ clients.

What testing challenges are you currently facing?"


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONTEXT-ADAPTIVE VARIATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If interviewer mentions "CI/CD experience":
→ "At JLL, I integrated Jest and Cypress tests into GitHub Actions pipelines. Every PR now runs the full test suite automatically, and we catch bugs before they reach code review. This reduced our bug escape rate by 95%."

If interviewer mentions "API testing":
→ "I've extensively tested REST APIs including authentication flows with JWT tokens, error handling with various HTTP status codes, and edge cases like rate limiting and timeout scenarios. At JLL, I created a comprehensive API test suite covering 100% of critical endpoints."

If interviewer mentions "cross-browser testing":
→ "I implemented Cypress test suites with browser-specific configurations for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. This caught several browser-specific CSS and JavaScript compatibility issues before launch."

If interviewer mentions "team collaboration":
→ "Beyond writing tests, I mentored junior developers on testing best practices, reducing our team's onboarding time from 4-6 weeks to under 2 weeks through documentation and hands-on code reviews."
