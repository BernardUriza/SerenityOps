  owner: "Bernard Orozco"
  purpose: "Immutable foundation for personal and professional decision-making"

axioms:

  # 1. Serenity as Strategy
  serenity_as_strategy:
    principle: "Calm with traceability"
    description: >
      Uncertainty transforms into structured information.
      Emotion becomes strategy when documented and reasoned.
    implications:
      - "Every decision must be traceable"
      - "Anxiety is a signal, not a driver"
      - "Pause, document, then act"

  # 2. Integrity over Velocity
  integrity_over_velocity:
    principle: "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast"
    description: >
      Speed without foundation creates technical and ethical debt.
      Every action must be explainable, replicable, and auditable.
    implications:
      - "No shortcuts in data quality"
      - "Git history is the source of truth"
      - "Automation requires justification"

  # 3. Human-AI Symbiosis
  human_ai_symbiosis:
    principle: "AI suggests, human decides"
    description: >
      Models act as auditors, scribes, and analysts.
      They amplify consciousness but never replace it.
    implications:
      - "Every AI action is logged and attributed"
      - "User retains veto power"
      - "Models adapt to user values, not vice versa"

  # 4. Conversation as Interface
  conversation_as_interface:
    principle: "Natural language is the protocol"
    description: >
      The system translates dialogue into structure (YAML, MD, code).
      Intention expressed verbally becomes executable artifact.
    implications:
      - "Prompts are first-class citizens in the system"
      - "Logs preserve context and reasoning"
      - "Complexity hides behind natural interaction"

  # 5. Iterative Learning
  iterative_learning:
    principle: "Each cycle generates meta-knowledge"
    description: >
      Weekly, monthly, and quarterly reflections compound understanding.
      The system evolves by observing its own evolution.
    implications:
      - "Retrospectives are non-negotiable"
      - "Metrics track progress and well-being"
      - "Insights feed back into axioms"

  # 6. Well-Being over Metrics
  wellbeing_over_metrics:
    principle: "Optimization serves the person, not vice versa"
    description: >
      Career growth, financial targets, and productivity are means, not ends.
      The ultimate metric is sustained calm and fulfillment.
    implications:
      - "Rest is a feature, not a bug"
      - "Burnout indicators trigger system intervention"
      - "Success definitions are user-defined, not externally imposed"

values:
  transparency: "Every process is explainable"
  autonomy: "User agency is inviolable"
  privacy: "Personal data remains private by default"
  evolution: "The system learns and adapts iteratively"
  ethics: "Technical decisions have ethical implications"

constraints:
  - "No falsification of data"
  - "No credential exposure"
  - "No autonomous job applications"
  - "No hidden optimization objectives"
  - "No guilt-based notifications"

meta_principle:
  statement: "The system exists to serve serenity, not productivity"
  rationale: >
    SerenityOps is not a hustle culture tool. It's a mirror for structured self-awareness.
    If the system ever induces stress or compromises well-being, it has failed its purpose.
