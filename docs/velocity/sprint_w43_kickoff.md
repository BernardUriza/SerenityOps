## üé≤ Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|--------|
| All P0 cards in critical path | Low (20%) | High | Buffer 25% + 7-day work week | ‚úÖ Mitigated |
| Context switching overhead | Medium (40%) | Medium | WIP limit 2-3 cards | ‚úÖ Controlled |
| Velocity factor too optimistic | Medium (50%) | Medium | Using conservative 0.55x | ‚úÖ Adjusted |
| Labels not implemented yet | High (80%) | Low | Manual via Trello web (next step) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending |

### Active Blockers

## üìà Tracking & Reporting

### Daily Updates (Required)
**Location:** `docs/velocity/velocity_report_W43.md`

**Update daily:**
1. % completed per card
2. Hours invested (actual vs estimated)
3. Risks or blockers
4. Brief progress comment

### Burndown Tracking
**Initial state (Day 1):**
- Hours remaining: 15h planned / 8.25h effective
- Cards remaining: 3/3 (0% completion)
- Day 1 completed: 0h

**Target (Day 8):**
- Hours remaining: 0h
- Cards completed: 3/3 (100%)
- Velocity accuracy: <20% deviation

### Metrics to Track
- **Velocity Factor:** Actual hours / Planned hours
- **Completion Rate:** Cards done / Cards planned
- **WIP Violations:** Times WIP >3 cards
- **Estimation Error:** |Actual - Estimated| / Estimated

## üèÜ Sprint Outcomes (End State)

### Expected Deliverables
1. **CV Template Architecture** - Functional and scalable
2. **Icon Registry** - Refactored, zero console errors
3. **Pipeline Funnel Dashboard** - Rendered with mock data

### Expected Learnings
- Velocity accuracy: Is 0.55 realistic or needs adjustment?
- Estimation quality: How close are estimates to reality?
- WIP management: Can we maintain 2-3 card limit?
- Daily tracking: Is daily update cadence sustainable?

### Expected Actions for W44
- Adjust velocity factor based on W43 real data
- Refine estimation process if error >30%
- Implement labels in Trello (pending from W43)
- Plan 3-4 new cards based on velocity trend
