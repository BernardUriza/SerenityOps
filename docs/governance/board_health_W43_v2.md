- ✅ Velocity calculation now possible
- ✅ Tool used: `trello set-due` command

#### Phase 1.2 - Active Cards (7 cards)
**Policy Applied:**
- Cards in "In Progress" / "Testing" → assigned **2025-11-01** (Sprint W43 end)
- Cards in "Ready" → assigned **2025-11-03** (Sprint W44 start)

**Results:**
- ✅ 5 cards (In Progress + Testing) → 2025-11-01
- ✅ 2 cards (Ready) → 2025-11-03
- ✅ Sprint accountability established
- ✅ Tool used: `trello set-due` command

### Phase 2: Ownership Assignment

## 🎯 Governance Policies Established

### 1. Due Date Assignment Policy

**Rule:** All cards must have due dates based on their list location

**Implementation:**
- Cards in "Done" → assigned to sprint end date when completed
- Cards in "In Progress" / "Testing" → assigned to current sprint end date
- Cards in "Ready" → assigned to next sprint start date
- Cards in "Backlog" → no due date required (not in active workflow)

**Enforcement:**
- Manual via `trello set-due` command
- Future: Trello Butler automation (recommended)

### 2. Ownership Policy

**Rule:** All execution cards (In Progress, Testing, Ready) must have assigned members

**Implementation:**
- Member assignment required before moving to execution lists
- Default assignment: Primary developer (Bernard Uriza Orozco)
- Multi-member cards allowed for collaborative work

**Enforcement:**
- Manual via `scripts/assign_card_members.py`
- Future: Trello Butler automation (recommended)

### 3. Traceability Policy

**Rule:** Completed cards must maintain full metadata for velocity tracking

**Required Metadata:**
- ✅ Due date (sprint end date)
- ✅ Completion date (automatically tracked by Trello)
- ✅ Assigned member (who completed it)
- ✅ Checklists (for breakdown tracking)
- ✅ Labels (for categorization)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Scripts Developed

### 1. Trello CLI Integration
**Tool:** `trello-cli-python` (pip package)
**Commands Used:**
- `trello boards` - List all boards
- `trello board-audit <board_id>` - Comprehensive audit
- `trello set-due <card_id> "YYYY-MM-DD"` - Set due dates
- `trello board-overview <board_id>` - Board statistics

### 2. Custom Python Scripts
**Script:** `scripts/assign_card_members.py`
**Purpose:** Bulk assign members to orphaned cards
**Features:**
- Loads credentials from `~/.trello_config.json`
- Uses py-trello library
- Assigns first board member to specified cards
- Provides success/failure feedback

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 scripts/assign_card_members.py
```

## 📊 Velocity Impact

### Traceability Restoration

**Before Remediation:**
- Cannot calculate cycle time for 10 completed cards
- Cannot measure velocity accuracy
- Cannot predict future sprint capacity

**After Remediation:**
- ✅ Full cycle time tracking for all 91 cards
- ✅ Velocity accuracy calculable (planned vs actual)
- ✅ Predictive capacity planning enabled
- ✅ Burndown charts accurate

### Metrics Now Available

1. **Cycle Time:** Time from "In Progress" → "Done" (with due dates)
2. **Lead Time:** Time from "To Do" → "Done"
3. **Velocity:** Story points / hours completed per sprint
4. **Completion Rate:** % cards completed before due date
5. **Ownership Ratio:** % cards with assigned owners (now 100%)

---

## 🚀 Recommendations for Sprint W44

### 1. Automation Setup (High Priority)
**Tool:** Trello Butler / Power-Ups

**Automations to Implement:**
- When card moves to "In Progress" → set due date to current sprint end
- When card moves to "Done" → require due date + owner
- When card moves to "Ready" → require owner assignment
- Weekly reminder: "Review cards without due dates"

**Estimated Setup Time:** 1 hour

### 2. Dashboard Creation (Medium Priority)
**Tool:** Trello Dashboard or external BI tool

**Dashboards to Create:**
- Sprint Burndown Chart (cards remaining vs days)
- Velocity Trend Chart (completed hours per sprint)
- Ownership Distribution (cards per member)
- Due Date Compliance (% on-time completions)

**Estimated Setup Time:** 2 hours

### 3. Label System Implementation (Low Priority)
**Status:** Designed but not implemented

**Labels to Add:**
- 🔵 Sprint-W43, 🔵 Sprint-W44, etc. (sprint labels)
- 🟢 Priority-High, 🟡 Priority-Medium, 🔴 Priority-Low
- 🟣 Type-Feature, 🟠 Type-Bug, 🔷 Type-Refactor
- 🟤 Status-Blocked, 🟢 Status-Ready

**Estimated Setup Time:** 30 minutes
