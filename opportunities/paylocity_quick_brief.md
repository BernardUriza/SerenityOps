# Paylocity Interview - Quick Brief ‚ö°
*Read this 5 minutes before the interview*

---

## Your Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"I'm Bernard, a senior fullstack developer with 10+ years experience. I've always owned both development AND testing in my projects. Most recently at JLL, I achieved 90% test coverage on our AI platform using Jest and Cypress, and I've integrated automated testing into CI/CD pipelines at multiple companies. I'm excited about this role because I can bring that same quality-first mindset to Paylocity's workflows team."

## Your #1 Strength for This Role
**90% test coverage at JLL using Jest + Cypress**
- This is your PROOF you can do the job
- Mention this in the first 2 minutes

---

## 3 Key Points to Hit
1. **Testing ownership:** "I've always done both dev and testing"
2. **Real results:** "90% coverage at JLL with Jest/Cypress"
3. **CI/CD integration:** "Tests run automatically in every pipeline"

---

## If They Ask About Selenium/Playwright
"I've used Cypress extensively for E2E testing. Selenium and Playwright solve the same problem with similar concepts - locators, assertions, async handling. I'm confident I can ramp up quickly because the fundamentals are the same."
